# Cell Shape and Orientation Control Galvanotactic Accuracy — Code & Simulations
This repository reproduces analyses and figures for electric-field sensing in migrating cells using
**maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)** and **Fokker–Planck** dynamics in elliptic coordinates. It includes simulation
kernels, analysis notebooks, and scripts to regenerate main plots from the paper.

## What’s inside
- **MLE estimators** for field-direction/strength from noisy orientation trajectories
- **Fokker–Planck solvers** (drift–diffusion on angle) with steady-state + transient analyses
- **Figure reproduction** scripts and small example datasets
- **CLI** entry points for demos and batch runs
